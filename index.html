            <p>
           i dont know how to say it but i really love her and i mean it, i think im not worthy enough to be with her. she's pretty, smart, kind, and loving. but im such a loser, even im scared to call or chat her if we had a fight. its not that i dont want to talk to her but im afraid shes gonna more get pissed at me. i cant understand her feelings, she always called me first if we had a fight because im not brave enough to call her first. I think that i am the problem in this relationship, i think that my ego is too high not hers. Im so afraid to lose her but on the other side i think that im not worthy of her, she deserve a good man more than me, she deserve the world.
